Our project is a mock social media platform.

Run Instructions:
1. Switch into the root folder "web-project" in the command line.
2. Run "npm install".
3. Ensure you have nodemon installed and if you don't run "npm install -g nodemon" (remove the -g if you don't want it installed globally).
4. You should be able to run "nodemon" now to start your webserver.
5. If you have an issue with "Cannot find module 'express'" then run "npm i express" in the root folder "web-project".
6. You should now be able to go to your browser and type in "localhost:3000" to view our website.
NOTE: Our project was built and tested using Chrome, there are already known issues with Firefox so it is recommended to use Chrome.
